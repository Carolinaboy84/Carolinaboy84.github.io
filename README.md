# About Me
## I like Photography, Gaming, Anime, Sports, and `Drone flying. 
## Places I recommend seeing if you ever get a chance. While in the Navy, I was stationed in Sasebo, Japan, so I did a lot of exploring.[Futago-ji Temple](https://www.visit-kyushu.com/en/see-and-do/spots/futagoji-temple/) Reasons why I recommend it because it is an amazing drive through the Japanese countryside, and this place has been around since 718. Another cool place I recommend is [Matama Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5x6V25MJEU&t=12s). This is a video of mine that I went to see. Please ignore the cringe music, as I was trying to find one that fits. It is a very beautiful place to visit, plus the store near it sells delicious Japanese ice cream.
